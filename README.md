Project putting into practice CSS Grid and and other acquired css skills

Here's a list of the most important skills I put into practice for this project:
1. CSS Grid
2. Media queries
3. Flexbox
4. Responsive web design

Steps taken to complete this project:
1. Write up html to represent the main grid sections in the dashboard (no content just yet!)
2. Style the main html in css to properly map out the webpage
3. Fill the html with dummy content to fill the page (this content will eventually be replaced by proper images and icons)
4. Style each individual grid section with either grid or flexbox
5. Add media queries to make the dashboard more responsive to window resizing
6. Replace dummy content with more professional content
7. Apply a slick color palette

***The hardest part in my opinion was working with the media queries to make a perfectly responsive website***

Potential future considerations:
1. Make the website more interactive (being able to click on the various options)
2. I was not able to make the main content entirely fit in the view port with a full screen resolution and
I would like to solve this in the future
